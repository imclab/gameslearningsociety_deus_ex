                            Videogames have become one of the hottest topics in media, education,
                            and technology. Recent research across fields as disparate as science,
                            literacy, history, visual processing, curriculum, and computer science
                            suggests that videogames aren't just fun – they're actually good for
                            your mind as well. In this three-credit course, we will discuss current
                            research on the kinds of thinking and learning that goes into videogames
                            and gaming culture. We'll investigate the benefits and drawbacks of this
                            digital gameplay, covering everything from perception and attention in
                            Left 4 Dead 2 to the development of historical understanding in
                            Civilization, from socialization in massively multiplayer online
                            games like World of Warcraft to issues of violence and racial
                            representation in titles like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3,
                            from the inherent tensions between contemporary youth culture
                            and traditional education to new developments in games for
                            learning intended to bridge that growing divide.

                            Games are both designed object but also emergent social practice,
                            and it is both aspects of games that make them a powerful "sociotechnical”
                            means of learning. In this course, we will examine how game communities
                            function as naturally occurring, self-sustaining, indigenous online
                            communities of learning and practice, the conditions under which such
                            learning happens, its means, and its ends. Throughout the semester, we
                            review sociocultural theories of learning, current research on game
                            communities, and methodologies for their investigation. Final project
                            for the course is a pilot study of a game community of one's choice.
                            Student will leave this course sufficiently prepared to conduct
                            theoretically grounded, empirical research on game communities and
                            their function for learning.

                            At the TechBoston event in March 2011, President Obama issued a call to
                            action, stating "I'm calling for investments in educational technology
                            that will help create… educational software that's as compelling as the
                            best video game.” A growing number of universities, companies, and
                            philanthropic organizations have risen to the challenge, establishing
                            programs not only in game studies but also in game design and development.
                            In this seminar, students review the state of play in the games for impact
                            area, the role of various stakeholders (federal government, universities,
                            philanthropy, and industry) in this domain, and both opportunities and
                            challenges to the movement. The course will function as a "do tank” (to
                            borrow a term from Beth Noveck), where students do actual domain work
                            of immediate relevance for various stakeholders including a landscape
                            analysis of the various subareas within the games for impact domain.
                            The course is based on an apprenticeship model that assumes that learning
                            arises through joint activity with an expert. Students should expert to
                            engage in collaborative work with an audience that extends beyond the
                            classroom walls. By the end of this course, students have a better
                            understanding of how various White House offices and federal agencies
                            work, and how they as emerging scholars might contribute to those agency
                            initiatives and policies.

                            Online tools allow interaction across a range of modalities, enabling not only
                            asynchronous and synchronous text as interaction but also voice-over-IP,
                            video-chatting, and even avatar mediated joint activity in fully rendered
                            online 3D worlds. The goal of this course is to develop a wider repertoire
                            and deeper understanding of research methods for analyzing the forms of
                            social interaction enabled by such tools. The focus of this course is on
                            the development of methodological chops, with weekly seminars organized
                            as data analysis sessions and the final course project consisting of an
                            in-depth analysis if one's own data.

                            This course explores information and digital literacies needed by today's online
                            consumers and producers.  Topics include ‘new literacies', media education,
                            digital divides, information quality, and online risks. To investigate these
                            issues, we complete four case studies: Wikipedia, blogs, online video, and
                            online videogames. Issues to be covered include access (digital divides,
                            power relations in online communities, regulation), analysis (assessing
                            credibility, evaluating risks, analyzing representation) and production
                            (video making, blogging, game making).
