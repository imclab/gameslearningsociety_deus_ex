                            Videogames have captured much national attention as a powerful learning technology.
                            Research across areas as disparate as perception, attention, science, literacy,
                            language learning, history, computer science, and curriculum design suggests that
                            videogames are not only engaging but, if designed well and placed in the right
                            context, good for thinking and learning as well. In this three-credit course, we
                            will discuss current research on the kinds of intellectual work that goes into
                            videogaming; how games and their culture foster complex forms of knowledge, skills,
                            and dispositions; and how games can be designed to capitalize on this capacity for
                            educational ends. We’ll investigate the benefits and drawbacks of this digital gameplay,
                            covering everything from perception and attention in first person shooters to the development
                            of historical understanding in games like the Civilization series, from sociocultural
                            learning in massively multiplayer online games like World of Warcraft to computational
                            reasoning in titles like Kodu, from the inherent tensions between contemporary youth
                            culture and traditional education to new developments in games for learning intended
                            to bridge that growing divide.

                            This course meets Comm B requirements, so it is writing intensive. Throughout the semester, you will
                            gain familiarity with current research on course topics, develop a language for reflection on the
                            cognitive and educational merits and drawbacks of growing up on games and gaming culture, and gain
                            new insights into the ways in which your digital playspaces and pastimes shape how you (and your peers)
                            think and learn.

                            Discourse analysis is a method of closely examining language in order to connect the micro-dynamics
                            of language-in-use with the macro-dynamics of culture and society. Discourse analysis approaches
                            language as action and affiliation, attending to both the content of what is said as well as its
                            structure or the way in which it is said (which is, in fact, also part of its content) across
                            the idea unit (clause), the sentence, the paragraph, and even longer pieces of text. By unveiling
                            the work that is done through language in social interaction, discourse analysis functions as a
                            particularly powerful means for examining, for example, the actual activities that participants
                            are involved in, the value structures in play, and the identities that are being performed.

                        <p>
                            The goal of this course is to develop a deeper understanding of and facility with Discourse Analysis
                            as a means for analyzing language in use, particularly in the context of teaching and learning in
                            both formal and informal contexts. Throughout the semester, we will apply a range of discourse
                            analysis techniques that enable the researcher to empirically document and assess the mechanisms
                            by which individuals collaborate, establish intersubjectivity, share their understandings, and
                            learn from one another. Students in the course will engage in weekly data analysis sessions
                            as a way to develop their own skills in the methods covered which will culminate in a final
                            course project.

                            This course investigates how school leaders develop and use technologies to improve student learning.
                            The role of technology in school leadership has changed in recent years from supporting the technologies
                            school leaders and teachers use in their work to how leaders develop and manage complex technological
                            systems to effect change in schools.

                            The course will be organized around two central issues: how learning technologies are used and developed
                            in the world, and how learning technologies fit into schools. The first issue will address the radical
                            changes that digital technologies have made in the daily lives of students, teachers and citizens – ranging
                            from video gaming and mobile, to social networking and media design. The second addresses the technological
                            challenges faced by leaders interested in creating the schools of tomorrow – how leaders build on the
                            technological capacity of existing schools to improve learning for students.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Course activities and readings will focus on recent research on technology, learning and leadership
                            and hands-on investigations of the technologies that shape schools and learning. We will study and use
                            technologies to facilitate planning, promote and measure student learning, and administrative technologies
                            to assess and organize student learning. We will also examine how technologies such as virtual schools,
                            video games, mobile and wireless technologies will reframe the future of schooling and learning. Our
                            investigations will take account of the ways technologies frame and are framed by institutional cultures.
                            The seminar format will emphasize the experiences of participants in the conduct and topics addressed
                            in the course.
