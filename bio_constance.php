                    Constance Steinkuehler is an Associate Professor in Digital Media at the University of 
                    Wisconsin–Madison and co-directs the Games+Learning+Society (GLS) center at the Wisconsin
                    Institute of Discovery and chairs their annual GLS Conference. Her research is on cognition and 
                    learning in commercial entertainment games and games designed for impact. In 2011-2012, 
                    she served as Senior Policy Analyst in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy 
                    (OSTP) where she advised on national initiatives related to games. Policy work there included 
                    the coordination of cross-agency efforts to leverage games toward national priority areas 
                    (e.g. childhood obesity, early literacy, STEM education) and the creation of new partnerships 
                    to support an ecosystem for more diversified innovation in commercial and non-commercial 
                    games. She also played a central role in recent meetings through the Vice President's office on 
                    videogames and violence.
